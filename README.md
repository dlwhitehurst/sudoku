# sudoku

This README describes this Java project and my strategy for solving a Sudoku puzzle using 
a computer instead of a human. This is a fun exercise for me to 1) solve the puzzle 2) and
then see how fast I can solve the puzzle afterward by refactoring.

## Strategy

My strategy is to first provide data structures for the puzzle and operations on the puzzle.
So far, I'm ready to change the data structures, to make them better, but I'm going to wait
until the puzzle is solved. To solve the puzzle, I must identify and understand the rules.

If this then that can be done ...

1. Rows with 8 numbers (8 of 9) can be completed.
2. Columns with 8 numbers (8 of 9) can be completed.
3. Blocks with 8 numbers (8 of 9) can be completed.
